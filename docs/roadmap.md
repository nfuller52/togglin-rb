🎯 Tier 1: Core MVP (must have to compete at all)

These are the table stakes for any feature flagging product:

Flag creation & management (boolean, multivariate, percentage rollout).

Client SDKs (start with JS/Node + Python; others later).

Evaluation logic — fast and cached (your idea of Cloudflare Workers delivery here is killer: low-latency + cost-efficient).

Environments (at least dev/staging/prod).

Targeting rules (by user, group, org ID, attributes).

Basic audit log (who changed what flag, when).

Dashboard/GUI to view & toggle flags easily.

⚡ This gives dev teams confidence they can replace LaunchDarkly on small projects.

🎯 Tier 2: Differentiators (get attention vs LaunchDarkly)

These make engineers say “Oh wow, this is better / easier”:

Code-first flag creation → declare flags in code and sync to dashboard automatically.

Flag DAGs (dependencies) — e.g., “flag A requires flag B.” (LD doesn’t have this natively).

SDK logging of unused flags — helps keep code clean (huge pain point).

Time-based rollout — schedule on/off without midnight deploys.

A/B testing hooks (flag values → experiment framework).

⚡ These hit exactly where LaunchDarkly feels clunky or expensive. “More power, less work.”

🎯 Tier 3: Enterprise-readiness (land big accounts later)

You don’t need this at MVP, but plan for it:

SSO / SCIM (Okta, AzureAD).

Granular role-based access control (RBAC).

Exportable audit logs / compliance reports (SOC2, HIPAA, etc.).

Multi-project orgs with billing separation.

High-availability + SLA support.

⚡ Necessary to close $100k+ deals, but not needed to get developer love early.

My recommendation for first build order:

Core flag engine + SDKs (Tier 1).

Dashboard with environments + audit logs.

Code-first flag creation (first real differentiator).

Flag DAGs + time-based rollout.

A/B testing hooks + unused flag detection.

Circle back to enterprise features once you have traction.

✅ If you start with Core + a few bold differentiators, you can position Togglin as “developer-first, faster, and smarter than LaunchDarkly.”
